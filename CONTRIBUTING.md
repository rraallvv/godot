## PLEASE READ: 

### Reporting Bugs:

If you are reporting a new issue, you will make our life much simpler (and the fix come much sooner):

#### Specify the Platform 
 
Godot runs on a large variety of platforms and operating systems and devices. If you believe your issue is device/platform dependent, please specify:
* Operating System
* Device
* GPU Model

#### Specify Reproduction Steps

Many bugs can't be reproduced unless specific steps are taken. Please **specify the exact steps** that must be taken to reproduce the condition.

#### Provide a Simple,  Example Project

Sometimes an unexpected behavior happens in your project. In such case understand that:

* What happens to you may not happen to other users.
* We can't take the time a look at your project, learn it and then figure out why it's failing. 
 
To speed up our work, prepare for us **a simple project** that isolates and reproduces the issue. This is always the **the best way for us to fix it**.

### Contributing Pull Requests

If you are adding new engine funcitonality, please make sure that:

* This functionality is desired.
* You talked to other developers on how to implement it best.
* Even if it won't be merged, your PR is useful for future work on another developer.

Thanks!
